## Notes
- delete this file for final submission
- this `client` folder serves as the front-end of this project
- front-end is basically the part of the app that the user sees
- most of the files we need to modify are in the `./src/components` folder

## To-Do
- set up client-side routing with react-router (somewhat done, can always edit later)
- create home page component (in progress)
- design game logic, starting with singleplayer mode (in progress)
- find online API to generate random words for the game
- modify singleplayer for multiplayer mode (not started)
- work on styling and css last
- create leaderboard component (not started)

## Styling, CSS & Animations
- create custom modals with animation
- keep to a consistent colour scheme/theme
- add css styling + animation to buttons (e.g buttons darken slightly when cursor hovers over it)
- design the gallows
- use media queries for different layouts for different viewport sizes (phone, tablet, laptop)
- flexboxes
