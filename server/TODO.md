## Notes
- delete this file for final submission
- this `server` folder serves as the backend of this project
- backend in layman's terms: the part of the app that users can't access, such as server routing and databases
- for this project, it's only required for implementation of the leaderboard feature because we need to use a database to store the users and their scores
- would be good to include since it's more technically challenging
- can drop if time does not permit since the game should work well on its own, with a few manageable changes

## To-Do
- set up MongoDB database to store users and scores
- figure out how to create backend with MERN stack (use express, node & mongoose/mongodb)
